Starting Point: determination and contrast of hypothesis.

Null Hypotesis (H0): Fluid Overload not becomes meaningful on the evolution of patients with septic shock.
Defect action: Not change protocol, continue with actual proceedings.

Alternative Hypotesis (H1): Fluid Overload becomes meaningful on the evolution of patients with septic shock. Fluid resucitation excessive to impact in prognosis.
Alternative action: protocol with adjustment of procedures that allow to minimize the evidences of consequences and worsening associated to a gain of volume.

Strategies to make post actions, with new model for evaluation:

Analyze data samples to identify features and distribution of cases type, and find a percentage value to minimize impact on the evolution of patients.

Make Sample to evaluate impact, (e.g. with volume gains greater than 10%).

If meaningful, determine a cut-off value of volume gain, after the third day of admission, or until the first week on all hospitalization.
